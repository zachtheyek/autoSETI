project still ongoing; most up-to-date work in `Kaggle_BERT.ipynb`.

# Introduction

This repo contains a Transformer model, trained on the [Breakthrough Listen Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/seti-breakthrough-listen/overview/data-information), which are dynamic spectra generated from real observations taken using the Green Bank Telescope, with some containing artificially injected signals using [setigen](https://github.com/bbrzycki/setigen). We refer to the former as the "haystack", and the latter as the "needles".
